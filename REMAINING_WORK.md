## Total Work Remaining:
- **17 destinations** to update
- **42 total sections** to add
- All have CSS ✅
- All need content ⏳

## Recommendation:
Due to the volume, consider:
1. Prioritizing destinations you've actually visited (for authentic content)
2. Adding placeholder content that can be refined later
3. Doing 2-3 destinations per day to maintain quality
4. Using the Barcelona/Berlin/Venice templates as guides
